####### STORY #######

The world is at an era of Eco-Consciousness, after almost succumbing to a polution apocalypse. Recycling everything is essential do manking survival on planet Earth, so every trash is taken to recycling plants. Due to the high polution, a banana peel that was going to be recycled developed human-like consciousness and abilities that only a videogame character would have.

As Bananixo, the banana peel, your objective is to flee the Recycling Plant and obtain your freedom. For this, you must go through several recycling rooms, using the controllers to recycle other trash correctly, so while the trash is being processed and the humans are not looking, you may reach the door leading to the next room and maybe your freedom. But be carefull! Incorrectly placed trashes may become incredibly hard annoyances in your journey, as puddle of organic trash that delay you, glass walls that block your path and mad malfunctioning toy robots!

Go Bananixo! Time won't wait! Flee the recycling plant before you are trapped and turned into fertilizer!
